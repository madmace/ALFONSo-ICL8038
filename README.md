# ALFONSo based on ICL8038
Analog Low Frequency Oscillator Nolinear Sequencer MK-ICL8038

## Meta

Scope:

- The project from my passion of analog synthesizers and the love of the patterns, rhythms and mats that colored the majority of the 70s and 80s classics. In particular the analog sequencers and LFOs.
- The use of analog IC monolith signal generators operated in BF in the 1Hz band up to 25KHz. Can be used as VCO/LFO. This first research *intentionally* uses the older, now obsolete, but well known **Intersil ICL8038**.
- The digital control interface via USB is based on an *old and well-known* Microchip **18-series** microcontroller. The **PIC18F4550** is a widely used mC and there is a large amount of example code and tutorials available on the web.
  However, I personally always suggest having its datasheet handy and dedicating the time to understand its correct functioning.
